# Distro support

Generally any Linux distribution will work with some alteration. Very few
distros currently work out of the box on this tablet due to the use of a 32
bit firmware on an amd64 Atom CPU.

- Debian (using [mixed mode](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/10.6.0+nonfree/multi-arch/iso-cd/ "Mixed mode ISO"))
- Ubuntu (using Linuxium's [isorespin.sh](http://linuxiumcomau.blogspot.com.au/2017/06/customizing-ubuntu-isos-documentation.html))
- Void Linux
- [OpenBSD](openbsd/), not a Linux distro but includes support for bootia32.efi on the
  install media (install61.fs).
- [Fedora 35](https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/35/Workstation/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-35-1.2.iso)

# Configuration

## Display

By default the RCA Cambio runs in portrait mode. To change it to landscape mode, edit `/etc/default/grub` and update `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`:

- if you're using only the text terminal, append `video=efifb fbcon=rotate:1`.
- if you're using a desktop environment, append `video=DSI-1:panel_orientation=right_side_up`.

Update GRUB by running `sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg` on Fedora or `sudo update-grub` on Debian or Ubuntu.

Other [display orientations](https://docs.kernel.org/fb/modedb.html) are possible.

You can confirm your video display by:

1. Getting the card devices by executing `ls /sys/class/drm`.
2. Finding the one for your display, running `cat /sys/class/drm/<card device name here>/modes` to see the resolution (800x1280) and determining which is which (mine was `card0-DSI-1`).

### Known issues and limitations

Currently there's [no way to rotate the screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#gfxmode) in GRUB.

Linux Kernel 4.11 and higher is needed for DRM video acceleration.
